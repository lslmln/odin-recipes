    <div class="section"><h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A beloved Singaporean noodle dish that translates to “minced meat noodles.” The recipe typically features springy egg noodles tossed in a punchy sauce made from black vinegar, soy sauce, chili paste, and lard oil, giving it a perfect balance of tang, spice, and umami. Topped with seasoned minced pork, sliced mushrooms, braised mushrooms, fishballs or fishcakes, and sometimes a soft-boiled egg or crispy pork lard, the dish is both hearty and deeply flavorful. Some versions include soup on the side or come in a soupy form altogether. Making bak chor mee at home involves preparing each component—noodles, sauce, toppings—separately and combining them just before serving to preserve the texture and intensity of flavors.</p></div>

   <div class="section"><h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pot, simmer pork bones, garlic, and ikan bilis (dried anchovies) for 30–45 minutes. Strain and keep warm — this is your light broth to serve on the side or for boiling ingredients.</li>
        <li>Rehydrate dried shiitake mushrooms, then slice and simmer them in a mixture of dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, and a splash of mushroom soaking water until soft and flavorful.</li>
        <li>Blanch minced pork, sliced pork, liver, and fishballs/fishcakes briefly in the soup. Season the minced pork lightly with soy sauce, pepper, and a touch of sesame oil if desired.</li>
        <li>In a separate pot, boil egg noodles (mee pok or mee kia) until just tender (usually 30–60 seconds). Rinse quickly under cold water, then dip again in hot water briefly before tossing in the sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with a small bowl of soup on the side and some pickled green chilies.</li>
