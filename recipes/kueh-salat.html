    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kueh Salat is a beloved traditional Malay and Peranakan dessert consisting of two distinct, flavorful layers: a bottom layer of glutinous rice infused with rich coconut milk and lightly salted for balance, and a smooth, vibrant green top layer made from a custard of pandan juice, coconut milk, eggs, and sugar. The combination of creamy pandan custard and chewy coconut rice creates a harmonious blend of textures and flavorsâ€”fragrant, slightly salty, and gently sweet. Often enjoyed as a tea-time treat or festive delicacy, Kueh Salat showcases the rich culinary heritage of Southeast Asia through its simplicity and elegance.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>300g glutinous rice (soaked for at least 4 hours or overnight)</li>
        <li>200ml thick coconut milk</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>S few drops of blue pea flower extract (for natural blue coloring)</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>180ml pandan juice (made by blending pandan leaves with water and straining)</li>
        <li>120g sugar</li>
        <li>50g plain flour</li>
        <li>25g cornflour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak 300g glutinous rice for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Drain the rice and mix with coconut milk, salt and blue pea flower extract.</li>
        <li>Transfer rice to a greased 8-inch square or round steaming pan.</li>
        <li>Steam over medium heat for 20 to 25 minutes or until fully cooked and tender.</li>
        <li>Once done, press the rice firmly into a compact, even layer using a spatula or the back of a spoon. Keep warm.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together eggs, coconut milk, pandan juice, sugar, plain flour, cornflour and salt.</li>
        <li>Strain the mixture to remove lumps and bubbles for a smoother finish.</li>
        <li>Pour the custard over the pressed rice layer (tap the pan lightly to remove air bubbles).</li>
        <li>Steam over low heat for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the custard sets gently (a skewer should come out mostly clean).</li>
        <li>Once done, let it cool completely (1 to 2 hours) before cutting to ensure clean slices.</li>
    </ol>
